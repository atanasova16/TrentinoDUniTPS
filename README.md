# KDI-2021-Project-Template
This repository is a template for each KDI-Project developed during the KDI2021-22 course

This particular one is about engineering of a knowledge graph about “Digital University: Theses, Publications, and Staff”. The graph consists of a knowledge layer and a data layer. Resources are divided in folders about them both, divided further in the stages of the processes. All the resources are collected and stored to allow for inspection and possible reusability. 
Entities are instances of the E-type classes, which have their own data properties, as well as object properties which connect them.
